### Hi there 👋

I am a Distinguished Engineer in IBM Cloud Complex Workload Onboarding & Client Assurance. As part of the worldwide team, I am responsible for Architecture and Solutions for Cloud Service Management and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). I consult with IBM’s strategic customers, lead Cloud Adoption and Transformation initiatives, and perform RedTeam reviews globally. In addition, I am the global profession lead for SRE in IBM, member of the [IBM Academy of Technology](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/academy-of-technology/) (AoT), and chair the AoT Technical Committee for DevSecOps and SRE. 

I co-authored “[The Cloud Adoption Playbook](https://www.amazon.de/Cloud-Adoption-Playbook-Transforming-Organization/dp/1119491819)” (Wiley, 2018), documenting proven strategies for transforming an organization with the Cloud. Finally, I am  the Meetup Organizer for [SRE Meetup Munich](https://www.meetup.com/sremuc/).

Most of my activity on Git is inside of IBM, so you won't see much code here.
